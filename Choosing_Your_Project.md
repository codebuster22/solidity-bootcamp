# Choosing your project

The Project you choose will be your biggest highlight of your portfolio which will be presented in front of companies and live audience.

## How to choose your project?

Identify the problem statement towards which you are driven, a problem that you want to solve so badly.

## Why choosing a good project is very important?

You can choose a task management project or a decentralised project, but does it help you think really hard, does it help you think differently, does it help you relate to a bigger picture?

Choosing a right project, helps you not just become a developer, but a good developer.

**A good project doesn't challenge you to code, it challenges you to think.**
